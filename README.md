A collection of GitHub utilities that I use for working on GitHub regularly. Hopefully its useful to others.

## Browser extensions

* **Sticky pinned tabs** [This extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sticky-pinned-tabs/) ensures that if you pinned a tab, all links go to a new window. This is really useful if you pin a project page. There are some links on the project page that do not open in a new tab.

## Random scripts

This directory contains a web page that uses the GitHub API to pull up some reports. You can access it at:

https://andymckay.github.io/github-utils/


Or by running:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then accessing: http://localhost:8000/
